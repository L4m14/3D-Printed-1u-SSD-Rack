# 3D-Printed-1u-SSD-Rack

## Purpose

This 3D printed rack unit is designed to accommodate four 2.5" SSDs securely. It provides a convenient and organized solution for mounting SSDs within a system.

## Parts Needed

To assemble the 3D printed SSD rack unit, you will need the following parts:

- **1x SSD Rack_BodyL**
- **1x SSD Rack_BodyR**
- **2x SSD Rack_BodyC**
- **1x SSD Rack_EarL**
- **1x SSD Rack_EarR**
- **4x SSD Rack_Faces**
- **4x SSD Rack_Sabrent Adapter**
- **24x M3x5.6mm brass inserts**
- **6x M5 nuts**
- **16x M3x8mm screws**
  - Used for securing the Faces to the Body.
- **8x M3x10mm screws**
  - Used for securing the clamp of the Sabrent holder.
- **2x 447mm M5 rods**
  - Longer M5 rods for structural support.
- **1x 433mm M5 rod**
  - A shorter M5 rod for structural support of the rear of the unit.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to assemble and use the 3D printed SSD rack unit:

1. **Print the 3D Models:**
   - Use a 3D printer to produce the specified parts: BodyL, BodyR, BodyC (x2), EarL, EarR, Faces (x4), Sabrent Adapter (x4).

2. **Insert Brass Inserts:**
   - Install the 24 M3x5.6mm brass inserts into the designated locations on the 3D printed parts.

3. **Gather Parts:**
   - Ensure you have all the required parts listed above.

4. **Assemble the Unit:**
   - Attach BodyL, BodyR, BodyC (x2), EarL, and EarR together using the M5 rods.

5. **Attach Faces:**
   - Use M3x8mm screws to secure the Faces to the Body.

6. **Add Sabrent Adapters:**
   - Attach the Sabrent Adapters using the provided clamps and secure with M3x10mm screws.

7. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Tighten all screws securely, ensuring a stable and secure assembly.
